# üîç Search Integration Summary

## Overview

The Bureaucracy Oracle now includes real-time search capabilities powered by Tavily API to enhance responses with current regulatory information. This integration allows agents to access up-to-date data about exchange rates, regulations, and official decrees when answering user queries.

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Tavily Search Service**
- **Location**: `/agents/search_service.py`
- **Purpose**: Provides real-time web search capabilities for agents
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatic detection of queries requiring current information
  - Agent-specific search domain filtering
  - Intelligent caching with different durations for different content types
  - Formatted search results for LLM prompts

### 2. **Agent-Specific Search Configuration**
- **Location**: `/agents/search_config.py`
- **Configuration per agent**:
  - **BCRA**: Searches bcra.gob.ar, boletinoficial.gob.ar for exchange rates and communications
  - **COMEX**: Searches afip.gob.ar, tarifar.com for tariffs and trade regulations
  - **SENASA**: Searches senasa.gob.ar for phytosanitary protocols and requirements

### 3. **Intelligent Trigger System**
- **Temporal triggers**: "actual", "hoy", "vigente", "√∫ltimo", "2024", "2025"
- **Agent-specific triggers**: 
  - BCRA: "l√≠mite", "cotizaci√≥n", "d√≥lar", "tipo de cambio"
  - COMEX: "arancel", "ncm", "posici√≥n arancelaria"
  - SENASA: "protocolo", "certificado", "fitosanitario"

## üîß How the Search Integration Works

### Architecture Flow
```
User Query ‚Üí Agent Analysis ‚Üí Search Trigger Check ‚Üí Tavily API ‚Üí Enhanced Response
                                       ‚Üì
                                  Cache Check
                                       ‚Üì
                                 Format Results
```

### Process Steps

1. **Query Reception**: Agent receives user question
2. **Trigger Detection**: System checks for temporal or domain-specific triggers
3. **Cache Verification**: Checks if recent search results exist
   - Exchange rates: 1-hour cache
   - Regulations: 24-hour cache
4. **Search Execution**: If needed, queries Tavily API with:
   - Enhanced query with keywords and current year
   - Domain filtering for official sources
   - Advanced search depth for better results
5. **Result Processing**: 
   - Extracts key facts (percentages, amounts, dates)
   - Formats sources with titles and URLs
   - Creates summary for LLM context
6. **Response Enhancement**: Augments agent prompt with search results

## üöÄ Key Features and Benefits

### 1. **Automatic Activation**
- No manual intervention needed
- Activates only when queries contain specific triggers
- Preserves fast response times for queries not needing search

### 2. **Official Source Priority**
- Filters results to government domains (.gob.ar)
- Ensures regulatory accuracy
- Includes official bulletins and decrees

### 3. **Smart Caching**
- Reduces API calls and costs
- Faster responses for repeated queries
- Different cache durations based on content volatility

### 4. **Seamless Integration**
- Works transparently with existing agent architecture
- No changes needed to frontend or orchestrator
- Backward compatible when disabled

### 5. **Cost Efficiency**
- Only searches when necessary
- Caches results to avoid redundant searches
- Minimal overhead (~1.5 seconds average)

## üìä Testing Results

### A/B Test Summary (January 3, 2025)

#### Performance Metrics
- **Average duration without search**: 20.5 seconds
- **Average duration with search**: ~22.0 seconds
- **Search overhead**: ~1.5 seconds (7.3% increase)

#### Quality Improvements
1. **Specific Regulation Numbers**: 
   - Without: "10% tariff for notebooks"
   - With: "10% tariff per RG 5653/2025"

2. **Current Year References**:
   - Automatically includes 2025 regulations
   - Cites most recent communications and decrees

3. **Accuracy Enhancement**:
   - More precise limits and percentages
   - Updated protocol references
   - Current regulatory framework

### Test Examples

```
Question: "¬øQu√© aranceles pagan los notebooks?"
Without Search: Generic 10% mention
With Search: Specific RG 5653/2025, exact 10% tariff with regulation number
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use and Configure

### 1. **Enable Search Integration**
```bash
# In .env file
ENABLE_SEARCH=true
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here
```

### 2. **Restart Services**
```bash
docker-compose restart bcra comex senasa
```

### 3. **Verify Activation**
Check logs for search activation:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f bcra | grep "Search"
```

### 4. **Monitor Performance**
- Search activations logged per query
- Number of sources found
- Cache hit/miss rates visible in logs

### 5. **Customize Triggers** (Optional)
Edit `/agents/search_config.py` to:
- Add new trigger words
- Modify domain lists
- Adjust cache durations

## üìà Recommendations

### ‚úÖ **Enable for Production**
Based on testing results:
- Quality improvement justifies minimal overhead
- Users get more accurate, current information
- Particularly valuable for queries about:
  - Current exchange rates
  - Recent regulations
  - Updated protocols
  - New decrees or resolutions

### üéØ **Best Use Cases**
1. Questions containing "actual", "hoy", "vigente"
2. Queries about specific tariffs or percentages
3. Requests for current limits or regulations
4. Export/import protocol inquiries

### ‚ö° **Performance Tips**
1. Monitor API usage to control costs
2. Adjust cache durations based on content type
3. Consider disabling for non-regulatory queries
4. Use environment variable to quickly toggle on/off

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-source Integration**
   - Add Google Custom Search as fallback
   - Integrate Perplexity API for complex queries

2. **Advanced Caching**
   - Redis integration for distributed caching
   - Predictive pre-caching for common queries

3. **Search Analytics**
   - Track which queries trigger searches
   - Measure quality improvement metrics
   - A/B test different search strategies

4. **Enhanced Processing**
   - Extract tables and structured data
   - Parse PDF regulations directly
   - Summarize long regulatory documents

## üèÅ Conclusion

The search integration successfully enhances the Bureaucracy Oracle with real-time information while maintaining fast response times. The 7.3% performance overhead is minimal compared to the significant quality improvements in responses. Users now receive specific regulation numbers, current year references, and up-to-date information for their bureaucratic queries.

**Recommendation**: Enable search in production to provide users with the most accurate and current regulatory information available.
