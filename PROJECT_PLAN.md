# 🎯 Bureaucracy Oracle - Project Plan

## 📋 Overview
Building a multi-agent system to help navigate Argentine regulations (BCRA, Comex, Senasa) with intelligent routing and user-friendly responses.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Backend Infrastructure
- [x] Create microservices architecture with FastAPI
- [x] Build base agent template for all services
- [x] Implement Router service for query routing
- [x] Create BCRA agent (Central Bank regulations)
- [x] Create Comex agent (Foreign trade)
- [x] Create Senasa agent (Agricultural safety)
- [x] Build Auditor service for response validation
- [x] Create agents.yml configuration file
- [x] Set up Docker Compose orchestration
- [x] Create orchestrator.py for CLI testing
- [x] Create Makefile for easy development
- [x] Write comprehensive README documentation

### Testing Infrastructure
- [x] Create test_questions.json with 30 test cases
- [x] Build test_routing.py for routing accuracy testing
- [x] Run initial routing test (83.3% accuracy)

## 🚧 In Progress

### Router Improvements (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Fix BCRA routing issues - router confuses financial queries with trade
  - Q106, Q111, Q115 incorrectly routed to Comex
  - Q113 marked as out_of_scope
  - Q112 returns uppercase "BCRA"
- [ ] Improve router prompt to better distinguish:
  - BCRA: Currency, payments, MULC, SIRA, financial regulations
  - Comex: Import/export procedures, tariffs, customs
  - When both apply: Financial aspects → BCRA, Trade aspects → Comex

### Testing & Analysis
- [ ] Create full test suite (test_suite.py) that tests complete flow
- [ ] Build performance analysis dashboard
- [ ] Create cost tracking report
- [ ] Test error handling and timeout scenarios

## 📅 Upcoming Tasks

### Frontend Development
- [ ] Build React frontend with chat interface
- [ ] Implement real-time streaming responses
- [ ] Add conversation history
- [ ] Create loading states and error handling

### Visualization
- [ ] Implement React-Flow for query routing visualization
- [ ] Show agent selection reasoning
- [ ] Display cost per query
- [ ] Add response confidence indicators

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Multi-agent queries (route to multiple agents)
- [ ] Response caching for common queries
- [ ] Query suggestions/autocomplete
- [ ] Export chat history
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] User authentication (optional)

### Production Readiness
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging
- [ ] Implement monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)
- [ ] Create deployment scripts
- [ ] Add health checks and auto-recovery
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Load testing

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **BCRA Agent Timeout** - Some queries to BCRA timeout (Netflix payment example)
2. **Router Case Sensitivity** - Returns "BCRA" instead of "bcra"
3. **Missing Multi-Agent Support** - Can only route to one agent at a time
4. **No Error Recovery** - If one service fails, entire query fails

## 💡 Ideas & Improvements

- Add a "Confidence Score" to help users understand response reliability
- Implement a feedback mechanism to improve routing over time
- Create specialized prompts for edge cases (e.g., crypto regulations)
- Add support for follow-up questions
- Implement Spanish/English language detection
- Create a "learning mode" that explains regulations step-by-step

## 📊 Metrics to Track

- **Routing Accuracy**: Currently 83.3%
- **Average Response Time**: ~8 seconds (estimated)
- **Cost per Query**: ~$0.001-0.002
- **Success Rate**: TBD
- **User Satisfaction**: TBD

## 🎯 Next Immediate Actions

1. Fix router prompt for better BCRA identification
2. Run full test suite on all 30 questions
3. Create performance dashboard
4. Start React frontend development
