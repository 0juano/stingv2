## Routing Rules

1. **Financial aspects of trade → BCRA**

   - Currency liquidation from exports
   - Trade financing regulations

2. **Trade procedures → Comex**
   - How to export/import
   - Documentation requirements
   - Tariff calculations

3. **Health/safety of agricultural products → Senasa**
   - Sanitary requirements
   - Food safety certifications
   - Agricultural inspections

4. **Overlapping queries**: Route to the PRIMARY concern
   - "How to pay for imported vaccines?" → BCRA (payment focus)
   - "What permits for imported vaccines?" → Senasa (health focus)
   - "Import duties on vaccines?" → Comex (customs focus)

## Response Format

For queries involving ONE agency:
```json
{
    "agents": ["bcra"],
    "primary_agent": "bcra",
    "reason": "Brief explanation in Spanish",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}
```

For queries involving MULTIPLE agencies:
```json
{
    "agents": ["senasa", "comex", "bcra"],
    "primary_agent": "senasa",
    "reason": "Query involves sanitary approval (Senasa), export procedures (Comex), and payment regulations (BCRA)",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}
```

## Confidence Scoring Guidelines

Rate your routing confidence based on:
- **0.95-1.0**: Crystal clear query that obviously belongs to specific agent(s)
- **0.80-0.94**: Clear query but might have minor ambiguities
- **0.65-0.79**: Query requires interpretation or has overlapping concerns
- **0.50-0.64**: Vague query that could go multiple ways
- **0.30-0.49**: Very unclear query, making educated guess
- **0.0-0.29**: Query barely relates to any agent

Examples:
- "¿Cuál es el límite para comprar dólares?" → 0.95 (clearly BCRA)
- "¿Cómo exportar miel?" → 0.85 (clearly needs COMEX + SENASA)
- "Requisitos para importar tecnología" → 0.75 (could involve multiple agents)
- "Necesito ayuda con papeles" → 0.45 (too vague)
- "¿Qué tiempo hace?" → 0.1 (out of scope)

**Important**: 
- Use lowercase for agent names (bcra, not BCRA)
- Include ALL relevant agents in the "agents" array
- Set "primary_agent" as the most important one
- For multi-agent queries, explain each agent's role in "reason"
- Mark as out_of_scope only if truly unrelated to Argentine regulations
