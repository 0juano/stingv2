## 🧪 Testing/Review

- [ ] Run full test suite on all 230 questions
- [ ] Verify multi-agent routing works correctly
- [ ] Performance benchmarking of parallel agent calls


## ✅ Done

- [x] Create microservices architecture with FastAPI
- [x] Build base agent template for all services
- [x] Implement Router service for query routing
- [x] Create BCRA agent (Central Bank regulations)
- [x] Create Comex agent (Foreign trade)
- [x] Create Senasa agent (Agricultural safety)
- [x] Build Auditor service for response validation
- [x] Create agents.yml configuration file
- [x] Set up Docker Compose orchestration
- [x] Create orchestrator.py for CLI testing
- [x] Create Makefile for easy development
- [x] Write comprehensive README documentation
- [x] Create test_questions.json with 30 test cases
- [x] Build test_routing.py for routing accuracy testing
- [x] Run initial routing test (83.3% accuracy)
- [x] **Fix BCRA routing issues** (96.7% accuracy) 🎉
- [x] **Improve router prompt** 🎉
- [x] Create routing visualization HTML report
- [x] Test with 230 questions dataset
- [x] **Build React frontend with chat interface** 🎉
- [x] Create terminal-style UI with ASCII flow
- [x] **Multi-agent queries** (parallel processing) 🎉
- [x] Update router for multi-agent detection
- [x] Create orchestrator_multiagent.py
- [x] Modify auditor to merge multi-agent responses
- [x] Display which agents were consulted


## 🐛 Known Issues

- [ ] **BCRA Agent Timeout** - Netflix payment queries
- [ ] **Router Case Sensitivity** - Returns "BCRA" not "bcra"
- [x] ~~**Missing Multi-Agent Support** - Single agent only~~ ✅ FIXED
- [ ] **No Error Recovery** - Cascading failures


## 💡 Ideas

- [ ] Add Confidence Score to responses
- [ ] Implement feedback mechanism
- [ ] Create specialized crypto regulation prompts
- [ ] Add follow-up question support
- [ ] Spanish/English language detection
- [ ] Create "learning mode" for regulations

## ⁉️ Questions

- [x] Are all the agents comparmentalized in their own component? If we want to change the prompt or something of a single agent is it easy? Are we following best practices in the way we develop the agents?

### ✅ Answer:
Yes! The agents are well compartmentalized:

1. **Separate Docker containers**: Each agent (BCRA, Comex, Senasa) runs in its own container
2. **Independent codebases**: Each agent has its own folder under `/agents/` with:
   - `main.py` - The FastAPI service
   - `prompt.md` - The agent's specific prompt (easy to modify!)
   - `Dockerfile` - Container configuration
   - `requirements.txt` - Dependencies

3. **Best practices followed**:
   - ✅ Microservices architecture
   - ✅ Clean separation of concerns
   - ✅ Easy to modify prompts without affecting code
   - ✅ Independent scaling possible
   - ✅ Fault isolation (one agent failure doesn't affect others)

To change an agent's prompt:
```bash
# Edit the prompt
vim agents/bcra/prompt.md

# Rebuild and restart just that agent
docker-compose build bcra
docker-compose up -d bcra
```
